*Instructions below are for Linux only (it was tested on Ubuntu 20.04+)*

*Instructions for MacOS will be added soon...*

### Via Docker:

1. Build a Docker Image:

```sudo docker build -t deploy-reso .```

2. Run a Docker container:

```sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 deploy-reso```

### Without Docker (also works for Windows):

1. Upgrade pip and install Python dependencies

```pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt```

2. Install system-wide packages:

```apt-get install -y --fix-missing fluidsynth ffmpeg musescore3 libqt5core5a timidity```

3. Run a local server:

```uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000```
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If the above does not work for you (might be the case on Windows), try*

```uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000```

## Usage

1. Click *Start generating for free*.
2. Choose a music engine (*algorithmic / neural*).
3. Specify the desired properties of the composion.
4. Listen to this!

## Testing

*Instructions below are for Linux only (it was tested on Ubuntu 20.04+)*

Tests require Chrome browser and the according version of chromedriver installed in your system (do not forget to put path to the chromedriver in your system's `PATH` variable).

The app can be tested locally using

```python3 run_tests.py --port 8000 --run-server```

or 

```python3 run_tests.py --port 8000```

if you have already started the server on port 8000 in a separate process.

*For more info see `python3 run_tests.py --help`*
