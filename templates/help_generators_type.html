<p class="big-heading">Music engine types</p>
<p class="website-description">
    There are two main music engines implemented on RESO: algorithmic and neural.
</p>
<p class="sub-heading">
    Algorithmic
</p>
<p class="website-description">
    Fast and versatile, it can generate stunning pieces in mere seconds.
    This engine utilizes algorithms for music creation based on patterns. 
    It has a variety of options including Calm Melody, Waltz and Etude. Each of them supports 
    duration, tempo and scale configuration. Although algorithmic engine lacks diversity, it is an
    incredible tool for quick and reliable music making.
</p>
<p class="sub-heading">
    Neural
</p>
<p class="website-description">
    Imagine having your very own magical music composer at your fingertips - that's exactly what our neural music generator 
    is all about! This innovative tool can whip up beautiful piano melodies in the style of iconic composers like Mozart, Bach, and Chopin.
    Customize tempo and duration of your track and experience the true potential of modern neural networks. The outcome may be 
    unpredictable though, so don't hesitate to regenerate at any time to get even more unique tunes!  
</p>
<p class="website-description">
    There are also two sub-types of neural generators: LSTM and GPT-2. They both have their distinct sound and give you more variety of what 
    you can achieve with RESO. See which one you like more!
